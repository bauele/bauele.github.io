## Professional self-assessment
Enhancing my artifact during the course has allowed me to demonstrate my skills as a software engineer and web developer. Here are some of the ways that I have done so:

### Collaborating in a team environment
I used Git and Github while developing my enhanced artifact. Viewing my commit history will show that I have broken down each feature into a small, easily measurable unit of work. After each piece of work was done, I made a commit into my development branch. By doing so, I have clearly documented my workflow and progress in a way that other team members would be able to easily understand. Each commit description clearly explains what value was added during that particular commit.

### Communicating with stakeholders
Each enhancement includes an accompanying narrative document that explains the changes I made, why I made them, and how I went about making them. This demonstrates that I have the ability to explain my workflow and progress in a way that will satisfy project managers and supervisors. I am also able to break down technical details so that those who are not as technically minded can still understand them.

### Software engineering
For this category, I focused on creating an attractive, responsive user interface. I began by first creating a mobile-friendly layout for smaller devices, then adjusted the elements to take advantage of more space on bigger devices. I made sure to create a consistent visual experience by picking cohesive colors and styles for my elements on each page of the application.  

### Data structures and algorithms
In order for me to properly work with my data, I had to create data structures representing the shape of it. This allowed me to easily store and retrieve item and account data from the databases and make use of them in my application. I also needed to make use of sorting algorithms so that the user could sort the items on their dashboard page in a variety of different ways to fit their needs. 


### Databases
Nearly every web application demands some sort of data persistence, as well as the ability to modify or delete data. I used Google Firestore to store user data in the cloud, thereby allowing users to access their account and data from any device. While interacting with the dashboard page, users are able to add items, edit items, and delete them altogether.

### Security
Security is a very important area of focus for any software project. In order to provide account services to users while maintaining a high level of security, I opted to make use of Google Authentication and Google Firestore. By doing so, I removed the need for me to store any personal information on my own servers. Instead, my user credentials and database information would be maintained by a company with more security measures than I could reasonably implement in my own project. 
Below I have included both the original and enhanced artifacts, as well as narrative documents fully explaining each enhancement that was made. I’ve chosen to use the same project for all enhancement categories, which demonstrates my ability to create an attractive, user-friendly, fully functional full-stack web application. 


## Enhancement Narratives
The following documents explain my previous artifact's performance in each category, as well as the steps that I took to add each enhancement. I also detail what challenges I may have faced along the way and how I overcame them.

## Original Artifact
The repository for my original artifact can be found [here](https://github.com/bauele/CS-360-Mobile-Architecture-and-Programming). This contains all of the code for the project in a downloadable zip file. 

## Informal Code Review
[Code Review](https://trackr.bauele.com/external/code_review.mp4) - In this video, I first introduce the artifact that I initially created for the final project of my CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. I identify the current functionality of the application, then I dive into the specifics on how some of those features work. I also discuss what type of improvements I will be making for the enhanced artifact, as well as how I might go about developing those improvements.
