## Informal Code Review
[Code Review](https://trackr.bauele.com/external/code_review.mp4) - In this video, I first introduce the artifact that I initially created for the final project of my CS-360 Mobile Architecture and Programming course. I identify the current functionality of the application, then I dive into the specifics on how some of those features work. I also discuss what type of improvements I will be making for the enhanced artifact, as well as how I might go about developing those improvements.
